ResRec is an app that provides a simple interface for coworkers to share their favorite restaurants to host business meetings, client dinners and other events associated with their company.

Geared toward event coordinators and administrators, this app is designed to create a simple way for a small group to reccomend restaurants by intputting the restauarant info into the app along with details about what kind of event the restaurant was used for. The users can not only input restaurants they like, but then also comment on other restuarants (maybe if they used a certain restaurant, they can add their own thoughts to the record)

Currently the app displays all the restaurants on startup. It is possile to add a new restaurant, update the information for a current restaurant as well as delete a restaurant. Simiolarly each restaurant will display comments assocaited with that restaurant. The user can then create a new comment and delete any comments. Additionally, it is possible to search restaurants by city. This a is a crucial feature since travel is a big part of the need being ullfilled by the app.

**Current Issues & Future upgrades:**

The Login simply verfies that the password matches the password in the record associate with the given username.

In the future I will be completing the login functionality so that when a user adds a restaurant and/or comment, those records will be associated with that user. Jumping off from there, It will then be possilbe to search by user in order to see which restaurants a particular user has contributed to the over all database.

I will also be adding "search restaurants by cuisine" and "search restaurants by breakfast/lunch/dinner"
