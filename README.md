# ResRec

**_A restaurant recommendation application for coworkers and event planners_**

---

ResRec is an app that provides a simple interface for coworkers to share their favorite restaurants to host business meetings, client dinners and other events associated with their company.

Geared toward event coordinators and administrators, this app is designed to create a simple way for a small group to reccomend restaurants by intputting the restauarant info into the app along with details about what kind of event the restaurant was used for. The users can not only input restaurants they like, but then also comment on other restuarants (maybe if they used a certain restaurant, they can add their own thoughts to the record)
