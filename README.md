# ResRec

**_A restaurant recommendation application for coworkers and event planners_**

---

ResRec is an app that provides a simple interface for coworkers to share their favorite restaurants to host business meetings, client dinners and other events associated with their company.

Geared toward event coordinators and administrators, this app is designed to create a simple way for a small group to reccomend restaurants by intputting the restauaaunt info into the app and for what kind of event/meeting they used that restaurant. The users can not only input restaurants they like, but then also comment on other restuarants (maybe if they used a certain restaurant, they can add their own thoughts to the record)
